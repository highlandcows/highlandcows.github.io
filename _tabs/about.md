Highland Cows was a company that I started some years ago when I was doing some contract work for a friend. When that gig wound down, I felt some attachment
to the domain so I've kept it for my professional presence on the web.

## What I Do
I'm a coder with 30+ years experience in the technology industry, the bulk
of that in financial services. I'm currently an Engineering Manager at
[Yoco Technologies](https://www.yoco.co.za), a South African company that focuses on payments services for small businesses.
