## Whatâ€™s with Highland Cows?
Highland Cows is a company that I started in the early 2000s when I was doing contract work for a friend. That gig eventually wound down, but I felt a degree of attachment to the domain and kept it for my professional presence on the web.

## What I Do
I'm a coder with 30+ years experience in the technology industry, the bulk
of that in financial services. I'm currently an Engineering Manager at
[Yoco Technologies](https://www.yoco.com), a South African company that focuses on payments services for small businesses.

My resume is publicly available [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lX6rRKrkuO9zs-8CCwFWSSvyqVoahK7eIRK008SMI2M/edit?usp=sharing).
