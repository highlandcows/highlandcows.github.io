About 3 years ago, I was figuratively tapped on the shoulder and asked if I wanted to become an Engineering Manager (EM).  Up until that point, I had been an IC (Individual Contributor) and Tech Lead at my company. I had demonstrated skill in coaching and mentoring and I think the then EM lead thought it might be a good next step for me.

But to become a competent EM  has taken time and I’ve made my fair share of missteps along the way. In reviewing and understanding those missteps, I found that aligning my team and myself around the following 3 sets of values and their associated behaviors went a long way towards addressing the mistakes I had made:

- Embrace your team’s diversity
- Build trust
- The right team

## Embrace Your Team’s Diversity

This might seem obvious but as an EM, your job is not to craft a squad of “mini-me’s”. No matter how good you are at writing code, architecting systems, or troubleshooting production issues, that is not your primary job anymore.

Instead, your job is to figure out how you can create an environment for your staff where they can become good at those activities. For me, this took time because I thought that leading by example meant doing the things that were my team’s #1 Job(s).

One of the biggest problems I created was frequently corralling my team into a particular way of problem solving: mine. While there were situations where I had more knowledge than my team, I was stifling their growth. Even worse, it meant that my Tech Lead and I would periodically lock horns because I wasn’t giving him the room he needed to do his best.

Stopping this behavior was scary at first. It meant accepting that I had to develop new skills and figure out how to be both an effective manager and leader for the team. It also meant having to say “No” to colleagues who were used to the idea that I would solve their problems, be it diving into system logs to solve a problem or writing code. 

But stepping back from a hands-on technical role paid an important dividend: it meant that my team became better at solving all those things I used to do. My job became more about  communicating to other stakeholders in the company. Net result? Everyone inside and outside the team became more confident in the team’s execution.

Which brings me to my second observation.

## Build Trust

Building trust is one of the most important jobs that an EM needs to facilitate.

If your team’s ability to do their jobs is the engine driving projects forward, then trust is the lubricant. Without a spirit of trust, they will always hold back their thoughts and feelings about both the work that they are doing and the work that the rest of the team are doing. Moreover, if your team does not trust you, they will not tell you the truths that you need to hear. Without knowing what is going on in your team, your ability to communicate transparently to your stakeholders will falter, losing their trust.

To build trust in a team takes time. Accept that people will start from “competence trust”, i.e., trust that their colleagues (and you) are competent in their jobs. But, ideally, the team and you should be able to move to a place of “emotional trust” over time. This is the point where people feel that they can be themselves, share ideas, and admit mistakes.

There are many roads to this latter kind. For me, internalizing that my team had to come first has been an important step. For me, this meant visibly standing up to stakeholders who might jeopardize existing commitments. It has meant giving my team ownership of projects, start to finish, and making sure that every time they talked about their projects, I didn’t go into solution mode. It meant listening more than talking. Even when I thought I knew the answer (especially so!). 

Behaviors have to align with values. Once I removed myself from a position of competing with my team (see previous section), trust came easier. Once I made it clear that I would not accept behaviors that didn’t align with the team’s values, in or out of the team, my team began to trust me.

## The Right Team

Finally, you have to have the right team. This involves 4 activities:
1. Hiring the right people
2. Helping them grow so that they strengthen your team
3. Helping the team to recover when people leave
4. Letting people go when things are not working 

In a perfect world, an EM would have to consider #1, #2, and maybe #3. 

Unfortunately, there are going to be times when you don’t  have the right people on your team. It is your job to deal with that issue. Like many people, I found this to be a hard truth because I want to believe that the main obstacle to achieving any difficult goal is to work at it. I want that to be true for other people, and in particular, for people on my team who are struggling to be effective.

But, as the oft-quoted, fictional character Harry Callahan said, “A man has to know his limitations.”

What did this mean for me? It meant accepting that when someone on my team was underperforming, I had to time-box how long I was willing to wait for their improvement. 

So, make sure that:
- Both you and the person are clear on what improvement means
- You are not insisting that they be a “mini-me” (see the first section) 
- You and the person have mutual trust (see the second section)

If in the end, you have to let them go, make sure that they understand why it didn’t work. After all, either you or someone else at your company hired them after a rigorous interview process and thus your staff member may struggle with the right level of ownership. 

Finally, make sure that you understand why it didn’t work. Because the next step is discussing the issue with your team.

In order that the team can continue to be successful, they need to understand why their teammate’s performance was problematic. If you have been successful in your work to establish an open and trusting environment, this will be an easier conversation. If you are having regular check-ins with your team, performance expectations should be clear. I have found that a not uncommon situation is that the whole team may have backfilled for the person in question. Talk about this dynamic and make sure that people are clear on the difference between that and being supportive.

## Summary
Becoming an EM has been and continues to be challenging. But, I have found that many of the skills I need in order to be an effective one can be learned. Finally, the sense of reward and satisfaction I get each time I see my staff succeed creates a strong feedback loop for me to improve. This is what drives me to do better each day.
