I recently came across the site, [blogfeeds.net](https://blogfeeds.net), via the Hacker News RSS [feed](https://hnrss.org/best) I follow.  I found it interesting because it’s not like it’s a new idea per se, but it feels like it’s the right idea right now. I can see how it got traction in on Hacker News.

We’re all fatigued from the big social networks (see China Miéville’s [recent post](https://www.chinamieville.net/2151-2)) and a hand-crafted blog aggregation site turns down that insanity in a big way. 

In particular, it adds friction back into online communication.

Sometimes, friction is a good thing. It gives us a chance to breath before we speak. It gives us a chance to think before we speak.
