Following something of a tradition, I thought it might be useful to share a snapshot of the tools I use to write my blogs.

## Tool Summary

| Activity/Component |  URL | Description |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Site Builder  | [Chirpy](https://chirpy.cotes.page) | Chirpy is a [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) theme|
| Content Repository |  [GitHub](https://github.com/) | Uses  [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/what-is-github-pages#types-of-github-pages-sites) |
| DNS | [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com) | Used to point `highlandcows.com` to my content repo at GitHub |
| Editor | [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer) | Minimalist Markdown Editor |

It took me a few days to get things set up with Jekyll and GitHub pages. Once you are satisfied with that working, you can use Cloudflare (or the DNS provider of your choice) to point to your repo at GitHub.

## Workflow for new content

Posting new content is as simple as creating dated files in my local `_posts` directory, committing those to my local `git` repo and then pushing those changes to GitHub.

If you have questions about any of this, feel free to contact me. My email is at the bottom of navigation menu at left.
