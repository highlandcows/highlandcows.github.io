Earlier this year, I read a mini-interview in the 12 Jan 2025 edition of [The Installer](https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/12/24340864/ces-2025-tvs-nvidia-ai-gaming-installer ) with Manton Reece, the founder of [micro.blog](https://micro.blog) and in that interview, he shared that he had released a $1/month blogging platform called [micro.one](https://micro.one).

I signed up for an account and you can find me at [micro.highlandcows.com](https://micro.highlandcows.com). Hope to see you there!
